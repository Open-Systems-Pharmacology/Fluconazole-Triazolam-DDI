# Fluconazole-Triazolam-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Fluconazole-Triazolam-DDI studies for model evaluation

Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of our models regarding the Fluconazole-Triazolam DDI , including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. 

The reference model repositories can be found here:

- [Fluconazole PBPK model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Fluconazole-Model)
- [Triazolam PBPK model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Triazolam-Model)
